Please contact giles.knight@uwa.edu.au for any queries relating to this workbook, or refer to the Unit Outline on LMS for matters relating to the unit’s structure. Good luck and happy modelling! "],
["GettingStarted.html", "Getting Started", " Getting Started Tools You’ll Need Excel Excel is available on all computer laboratory PC’s and can be freely downloaded to personal devices here. You should already feel confident using Excel from your previous units, however if you need further guidance please visit UWA’s LinkedIn Learning resources. R To get started with R, first download the base R system onto your computer. By itself, this provides a rudimentary console for interacting with the R programming language. For a more user-friendly experience, download the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Terminology File types In this unit you will largely be dealing with two kinds of ‘R files’: R script files (e.g. Equations.R) and, R project files (e.g. Module2Biogeochem.Rproj) R scripts are the raw instructions that tell the R programming language what to do. Meanwhile, an R Project file simply creates an independent workplace environment for you to interact with and manage your scripts. It’s wise to create a new R Project file whenever you start working on a new project. Functions and packages Just like Excel, you can interact with your data using a variety of functions in R. Functions are the tools you use to get the job done. For example, the plot() function can be used to create graphs. R is an open source programming language, meaning anyone can create their own functions and bundle them up in a collection known as a package. Comments All programming languages allow the user to write comments on their code to assist in readability and structure. In R, a comment is defined as a line beginning with a #. Any characters written after the # are ignored by R and not executed. It’s good practice to get into the habit of commenting your R code as it will likely save you (or someone else!) a lot of time later down the track. # This is a comment! # Create a graph using the plot() function plot(my_data,variable1,col=&quot;red&quot;,ylab=&quot;My y-axis label&quot;) # Plot other variables onto the graph using the points() function points(my_data,variable2,col=&quot;blue&quot;) points(my_data,variable3,col=&quot;green&quot;) points(my_data,variable4,col=&quot;purple&quot;) To comment multiple lines of code at once in R Studio, pressCommand + Shift + Con MacOS orControl + Shift + Con Windows Further R resources Read the Introduction to R and Statistics book for a more detailed coverage on the core data visualisation and statistics capabilities in R Access UWA’s LinkedIn Learning portal the learn more about the basics of R Refer to some handy R cheatsheets R Studio cheatsheet ggplot2 data visualisation cheatsheet Unzipping files Many of the module resources found in this workbook are downloaded as ‘zipped’ (i.e. compressed) files. ‘Unzipping’ (i.e. extracting) these files is simple.

["module-1-modelling-in-excel.html", "Module 1: Modelling in Excel", " Module 1: Modelling in Excel Environmental Flows to an Estuary Objectives Become familiar with basic spreadsheet commands in Excel by conducting an environmental flow analysis and building a simple impact model. What are environmental flows? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity Case study Figure 1: Drain L inflows (yellow arrow) will be diverted (blue arrow) Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . To annotate this page please join the ‘Dynamics Class 2020’ here. Exercises You are given a time-series of daily river flow and need to assess how different diversion scenarios impact the freshwater flow delivery to a down stream estuary. For this flow time-series, calculate the volume of daily flow within the following bands 0-40; 40-80; 80-120; 120-200; 200-400; 400-1000; &gt;1000 Use a nested IF() statement in adjacent columns to partition flows For this flow time-series, calculate the number of days of daily flow within the above bands and work out annual average number of days Use COUNT() to get the number of entries in the column Calculate the annual amount of flow in total and in each band You may do the annual averaging manually or the pivot table method. For the pivot table method: Insert a new column B, Label it Year. Type the year number into the first cell, make sure it is formatted as a number. Click two times on the little square in the corner of the box. This will fill down the page. Repeat this at each year change and you will have the year only information which you can then use to summarise data. As the original date has day numbers and decimal time each one is unique so you end up with a record for each day. This way you get a record for each year. Use YEAR() to speed this step up Highlight all the data. It must have headings for each column or it won’t work. Go to “Insert” then “Pivot Table”. Click OK as you want the default settings. Then you just fiddle until you get what you want. The following is an example: Sort the years from highest to lowest total annual flow: Add a new column next to the flows indexing the years sequentially (i.e. 1, 2, 3…) Add a new column next to the indices calculating the probability of meeting the annual flow: \\(P(Yri) = \\frac{i}{\\text{number of years}+1}\\) c. Scatter plot the flow vs probability curve Sum each year Assess the amount of water available for flow diversion for two scenarios by adding a new time-series column for each option: Water below 50 ML/day and above 550 ML/day is NOT diverted Water below 150 ML/day and above 1000 ML/day is NOT diverted Construct a nested IF() that solves the following: Add two new columns for each of the above to work out cumulative amount (running total) of diverted water \\(\\text{Cumulated Volume} = \\text{Previous Cumulated Volume}+\\text{Today&#39;s Diverted Discharge}\\) Create a scatter plot of historical salinity (as EC) collected from the site marked in the map (+) vs daily discharge from the drain (see sheet: Estuary – Salinity). Fit a trendline to the data and display equation and R2 – this is a statistical model. In a new time-series column in the previous sheet, use the statistical model from above to predict a salinity time-series for the above station in the estuary under the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Q2: Table of the number of days daily flow within the above bands and annual average number of days Q3: Table of the annual amount of flow in total and in each band Q4: Table of annual flow by year with index and probability. Scatter plot of the flow vs probability curve Q6: Table of the cumulative amount of diverted water Q7 &amp; 8: Scatterplot of the EC vs. daily discharge from the drain, with trendline (hint: exponential), equation and R2 value Q9: Plot of the salinity timeseries of the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case In less than 100 words, discuss which is the most appropriate scenario choice for management of the estuary These are in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable "],
["M2-1.html", "Module 2: Biogeochemistry", " Module 2: Biogeochemistry Bacterially Mediated Organic Matter Oxidation Rates Objectives Become familiar with basic spread sheet commands in excel by building a simple biogeochemical model from chemical and mathematical equations. Become familiar with the program R Studio and compare it to Excel. Modelling concepts This model has variables of concentration and rate, no spatial dimensions, and it has a dimension of time. Last week’s model had variables of volume and concentration (salinity), and was also resolved in time. In coming weeks the models will be resolved in zero, one, two or three dimensions of space, and only some will be resolved in time. Going down the rows of the Excel spread sheet means going forward in time, as the differential equations break the time axis into hundreds of tiny little chunks. The concentration at any point in time may depend on concentration at the previous point in time. We use the notation concentrationt depends on concentrationt-1. Organic matter oxidation Organic matter (dead algae, leaves etc.) is oxidised by different bacteria that use a range of oxidants. The bacteria simultaneously consume organic matter and an oxidant, in a similar way to how humans consume carbohydrate and oxygen. Scientists have observed that there is a general sequence of oxidants used, based on the energy available for each process. When all of the oxidants are consumed, methanogenesis takes place, where bacteria use the organic matter alone without any oxidant. This is similar to the lactic acid metabolic system that the human body uses when oxygen is in short supply, such as when you go for a run. Remember that methane is a reduced byproduct, not an oxidant. Other reduced by-products include N2 gas, Mn2+ and Fe2+ metal ions, and the S2- anion. We can construct a model to determine the rates at which the oxidation takes place, and use the rates to determine other processes such as oxygen consumption, denitrification or phosphate adsorption. The rate is dependent on the concentration of the organic matter, \\(\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\), and a rate constant, \\(\\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\). The rate is not dependent on the concentration of the oxidant, until the oxidant concentration becomes very low: this process is included as a limitation term (With more O2 you do not become super; with less O2 you get sleepy). A Monod equation is used to limit the rate. \\[\\begin{equation} R_{O_{2}} = \\color{#00B0F0}{K_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{O_{2}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] The generally observed sequence of oxidants is modelled with an inhibition process, so that a higher energy yielding oxidant, such as oxygen, inhibits a lower energy oxidant such as iron. \\[\\begin{align*} R_{NO_{3}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{NO_{3}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{2}\\\\ R_{Mn} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Mn}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{3}\\\\ R_{Fe} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Fe}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{4} \\\\ R_{SO_{4}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{SO_{4}^{2-}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{5}\\\\ R_{Meth} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{SO_{4}}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{6}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] In this lab, we simulate a blob of aquatic sediment. It is a closed system, so that the initial concentrations react until they reach equilibrium. This system is also perfectly mixed, with an unchanging biomass of bacteria, and so there is no spatial resolution. This allows us to focus on the chemical reactions alone. Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet and R scripts for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Exercises Building the model in Excel Looking at the sequence of equations above: what is the difference between the limitation and the inhibition term? Have a good think about this. If concentration were amazingly bigger or smaller than the \\(K_{O_{x}}\\)1, what would happen to the rates of the higher and lower energy processes? For example, with a high oxygen concentration, what would happen to the manganese reduction rate? With a low oxygen and nitrate concentration, and a high manganese concentration, what would happen to the manganese oxidation rate? Complete the excel spreadsheet for iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Oxygen, nitrate and manganese are done already, so copy the method and use the equations at the tops of the columns. It is tedious, fiddly and there is a good chance that you will introduce bugs that are hard to find. This is the nature of Excel. Video 1: Match your Excel equations to the formulas on the sheet (Tip: Make this video fullscreen for better viewing). The rate is dependent on the concentration in the previous time step – this is called an explicit solution (as opposed to implicit). Complete the line plot (1) of relative oxidant concentration for iron and sulphate. Right click on the plot and use ‘Add data’, make the x axis time and the y axis relative concentration. It is easy to visualise if you keep the colours consistent, and choose the colours that you like. Adjust the values for the initial condition and the half-saturation constants and see how the lines move on your plot. Add more time steps underneath if you want to see what happens over the long term. Complete the area plot (2) of reaction rates, then play around with the numbers to test the sensitivities of the outputs to the parameter inputs Building the model in R Now the excel spreadsheet is working, the next step is to repeat the process in R. Open the R project and the three scripts: there is one in which you set the input parameters and initial conditions; one which has the equations; and one which is used for plotting the outputs. Read through them and become familiar with what is in each. Run each script in sequence, starting with Inputs, then Equations, then Plotting. The plotting script should make a plot appear in the bottom right corner. You can press Cmd+Enter on MacOS, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows instead of clicking the ‘Run’ button. Enter the inputs, equations and plotting scripts for iron, sulfate and methanogenesis reactions, just as you did in the excel spreadsheet. Remember that you just need a rate of methanogenesis: methane is not an oxidant like sulfate. Step 1: Enter the inputs for Iron. Don’t forget to ‘run’ these! Step 2: Write the equation. It should match Equation (4). Step 3: Graph it and repeat previous steps for the other oxidants. In the Plotting script, uncomment (remove the #s) the lines starting with png and dev.off. Now if you run the plot (3) again, it saves the plot to a .png file. You can edit the settings of the png line to create a high quality figure to put in the report. Now we have a working process-based model. This was the hard and boring part, but now we can be creative. So far we have established an initial condition and let it run to completion, but next we can model a hypothetical environmental situation. For example, imagine there were an oxygen fluctuation, perhaps from algal photosynthesis occurring in the day but not at night in a lake, or from the tidal movement of hypoxic water. In either Excel or R, create a new environmental situation that involves organic matter oxidation. Consider the assumptions you are making and how important they are. Use the model to test the effect of this situation on concentrations and rates. For example, what would happen if there were regular organic matter deposition as a boundary condition? Or maybe what if there were a constant oxygen concentration? What conditions might be needed to minimise methanogenesis? How could you maximise denitrification? I will give higher marks if you do something original and creative. Write a brief description of your new situation and create one plot (4) to explain your result. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in Excel Graph of rate (y) against time (x) area plot, for all oxidants Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in R Any figure of a new environmental situation you create, and a brief explanation of lessthan 100 words of how you used the model creatively. These are in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable Where \\(K_{O_{x}}\\) is the general term for the half saturation constant of any oxidant, for example \\(K_{O_{2}}\\), \\(K_{SO_{4}}\\) etc.↩︎ "],
