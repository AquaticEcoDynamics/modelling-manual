This workbook supplements the practical component of the Environmental Dynamics unit and is designed to develop your ability to model environmental systems. Each practical class has a corresponding module that will be added to the workbook as the semester progresses. If you are at all unfamiliar, or just a little bit rusty with using Excel or R, please visit the Getting Started section of this workbook before commencing the first module. Please contact giles.knight@uwa.edu.au for any queries relating to this workbook, or refer to the Unit Outline on LMS for matters relating to the unit’s structure. Good luck and happy modelling! "],
["GettingStarted.html", "Getting Started", " Getting Started Tools You’ll Need Excel Excel is available on all computer laboratory PC’s and can be freely downloaded to personal devices here. You should already feel confident using Excel from your previous units, however if you need further guidance please visit UWA’s LinkedIn Learning resources. R To get started with R, first download the base R system onto your computer. By itself, this provides a rudimentary console for interacting with the R programming language. For a more user-friendly experience, download the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Terminology File types In this unit you will largely be dealing with two kinds of ‘R files’: R script files (e.g. Equations.R) and, R project files (e.g. Module2Biogeochem.Rproj) R scripts are the raw instructions that tell the R programming language what to do. Meanwhile, an R Project file simply creates an independent workplace environment for you to interact with and manage your scripts. It’s wise to create a new R Project file whenever you start working on a new project. Functions and packages Just like Excel, you can interact with your data using a variety of functions in R. Functions are the tools you use to get the job done. For example, the plot() function can be used to create graphs. R is an open source programming language, meaning anyone can create their own functions and bundle them up in a collection known as a package. Comments All programming languages allow the user to write comments on their code to assist in readability and structure. In R, a comment is defined as a line beginning with a #. Any characters written after the # are ignored by R and not executed. It’s good practice to get into the habit of commenting your R code as it will likely save you (or someone else!) a lot of time later down the track. # This is a comment! # Create a graph using the plot() function plot(my_data,variable1,col=&quot;red&quot;,ylab=&quot;My y-axis label&quot;) # Plot other variables onto the graph using the points() function points(my_data,variable2,col=&quot;blue&quot;) points(my_data,variable3,col=&quot;green&quot;) points(my_data,variable4,col=&quot;purple&quot;) To comment multiple lines of code at once in R Studio, pressCommand + Shift + Con MacOS orControl + Shift + Con Windows Further R resources Read the Introduction to R and Statistics book for a more detailed coverage on the core data visualisation and statistics capabilities in R Access UWA’s LinkedIn Learning portal the learn more about the basics of R Refer to some handy R cheatsheets R Studio cheatsheet ggplot2 data visualisation cheatsheet Unzipping files Many of the module resources found in this workbook are downloaded as ‘zipped’ (i.e. compressed) files. ‘Unzipping’ (i.e. extracting) these files is simple. On MacOS, simply double click the ‘zipped’ file: On Windows, click ‘Extract All’ and follow the prompt: "],
["module-1-modelling-in-excel.html", "Module 1: Modelling in Excel", " Module 1: Modelling in Excel Environmental Flows to an Estuary Objectives Become familiar with basic spreadsheet commands in Excel by conducting an environmental flow analysis and building a simple impact model. What is an environmental flow? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity Case study Figure 1: Drain L inflows (yellow arrow) will be diverted (blue arrow) Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet: MODULE01_EnvFlowData.xls Exercises You are given a time-series of daily river flow and need to assess how different diversion scenarios impact the freshwater flow delivery to a down stream estuary. For this flow time-series, calculate the volume of daily flow within the following bands 0-40; 40-80; 80-120; 120-200; 200-400; 400-1000; &gt;1000 Use a nested IF() statement in adjacent columns to partition flows For this flow time-series, calculate the number of days daily flow within the above bands and work out annual average number of days Use COUNT() to get the number of entries in the column Calculate the annual amount of flow in total and in each band You may do the annual averaging manually or the pivot table method. For the pivot table method: Insert a new column B, Label it Year. Type the year number into the first cell, make sure it is formatted as a number. Click two times on the little square in the corner of the box. This will fill down the page. Repeat this at each year change and you will have the year only information which you can then use to summarise data. As the original date has day numbers and decimal time each one is unique so you end up with a record for each day. This way you get a record for each year. Use YEAR() to speed this step up Highlight all the data. It must have headings for each column or it won’t work. Go to “Insert” then “Pivot Table”. Click OK as you want the default settings. Then you just fiddle until you get what you want. The following is an example: Sort the years from highest to lowest flow: Add a new column next to the flows indexing the years sequentially (i.e. 1, 2, 3…) Add a new column next to the indices calculating the probability of meeting the annual flow: \\(P(Yri) = \\frac{i}{\\text{number of years}+1}\\) c. Scatter plot the flow vs probability curve Sum each year Assess the amount of water available for flow diversion for two scenarios by adding a new time-series column for each option: Water below 50 ML/day and above 550 ML/day is NOT diverted Water below 150 ML/day and above 1000 ML/day is NOT diverted Add two new columns for each of the above to work out cumulative amount of diverted water \\(X^{+1} = X +dX\\) Create a scatter plot of historical salinity (as EC) collected from the site marked in the map (+) vs daily discharge from the drain (see sheet: Estuary – Salinity). Fit a trendline to the data and display equation and R2 – this is a statistical model. In a new time-series column in the previous sheet, use the statistical model from above to predict a salinity time-series for the above station in the estuary under the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Q2: Table of the number of days daily flow within the above bands and annual average number of days Q3: Table of the annual amount of flow in total and in each band Q4: Table of annual flow by year with index and probability. Scatter plot of the flow vs probability curve Q6: Table of the cumulative amount of diverted water Q7 &amp; 8: Scatterplot of the EC vs. daily discharge from the drain, with trendline, equation and R2 value Q9: Plot of the salinity timeseries of the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case In less than 100 words, discuss which is the most appropriate scenario choice for management of the estuary These are in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable "],
