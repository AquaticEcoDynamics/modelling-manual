["GettingStarted.html", "Getting Started", " Getting Started Tools You’ll Need Excel Excel is available on all computer laboratory PC’s and can be freely downloaded to personal devices here. You should already feel confident using Excel from your previous units, however if you need further guidance please visit UWA’s LinkedIn Learning resources. R To get started with R, first download the base R system onto your computer. By itself, this provides a rudimentary console for interacting with the R programming language. For a more user-friendly experience, download the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Terminology File types In this unit you will largely be dealing with two kinds of ‘R files’: R script files (e.g. Equations.R) and, R project files (e.g. Module2Biogeochem.Rproj) R scripts are the raw instructions that tell the R programming language what to do. Meanwhile, an R Project file simply creates an independent workplace environment for you to interact with and manage your scripts. It’s wise to create a new R Project file whenever you start working on a new project. Functions and packages Just like Excel, you can interact with your data using a variety of functions in R. Functions are the tools you use to get the job done. For example, the plot() function can be used to create graphs. R is an open source programming language, meaning anyone can create their own functions and bundle them up in a collection known as a package. Comments All programming languages allow the user to write comments on their code to assist in readability and structure. In R, a comment is defined as a line beginning with a #. Any characters written after the # are ignored by R and not executed. It’s good practice to get into the habit of commenting your R code as it will likely save you (or someone else!) a lot of time later down the track. # This is a comment! # Create a graph using the plot() function plot(my_data,variable1,col=&quot;red&quot;,ylab=&quot;My y-axis label&quot;) # Plot other variables onto the graph using the points() function points(my_data,variable2,col=&quot;blue&quot;) points(my_data,variable3,col=&quot;green&quot;) points(my_data,variable4,col=&quot;purple&quot;) To comment multiple lines of code at once in R Studio, pressCommand + Shift + Con MacOS orControl + Shift + Con Windows Further R resources Read the Introduction to R and Statistics book for a more detailed coverage on the core data visualisation and statistics capabilities in R Access UWA’s LinkedIn Learning portal the learn more about the basics of R Refer to some handy R cheatsheets R Studio cheatsheet ggplot2 data visualisation cheatsheet Unzipping files Many of the module resources found in this workbook are downloaded as ‘zipped’ (i.e. compressed) files. ‘Unzipping’ (i.e. extracting) these files is simple.

["module-1-modelling-in-excel.html", "Module 1: Modelling in Excel", " Module 1: Modelling in Excel Environmental Flows to an Estuary Objectives Become familiar with basic spreadsheet commands in Excel by conducting an environmental flow analysis and building a simple impact model. What are environmental flows? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity Case study Figure 1: Drain L inflows (yellow arrow) will be diverted (blue arrow) Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . To annotate this page please join the ‘Dynamics Class 2020’ here. Exercises You are given a time-series of daily river flow and need to assess how different diversion scenarios impact the freshwater flow delivery to a down stream estuary. For this flow time-series, calculate the volume of daily flow within the following bands 0-40; 40-80; 80-120; 120-200; 200-400; 400-1000; &gt;1000 Use a nested IF() statement in adjacent columns to partition flows For this flow time-series, calculate the number of days of daily flow within the above bands and work out annual average number of days Use COUNT() to get the number of entries in the column Calculate the annual amount of flow in total and in each band You may do the annual averaging manually or the pivot table method. For the pivot table method: Insert a new column B, Label it Year. Type the year number into the first cell, make sure it is formatted as a number. Click two times on the little square in the corner of the box. This will fill down the page. Repeat this at each year change and you will have the year only information which you can then use to summarise data. As the original date has day numbers and decimal time each one is unique so you end up with a record for each day. This way you get a record for each year. Use YEAR() to speed this step up Highlight all the data. It must have headings for each column or it won’t work. Go to “Insert” then “Pivot Table”. Click OK as you want the default settings. Then you just fiddle until you get what you want. The following is an example: Sort the years from highest to lowest total annual flow: Add a new column next to the flows indexing the years sequentially (i.e. 1, 2, 3…) Add a new column next to the indices calculating the probability of meeting the annual flow: \\(P(Yri) = \\frac{i}{\\text{number of years}+1}\\) c. Scatter plot the flow vs probability curve Sum each year Assess the amount of water available for flow diversion for two scenarios by adding a new time-series column for each option: Water below 50 ML/day and above 550 ML/day is NOT diverted Water below 150 ML/day and above 1000 ML/day is NOT diverted Construct a nested IF() that solves the following: Add two new columns for each of the above to work out cumulative amount (running total) of diverted water \\(\\text{Cumulated Volume} = \\text{Previous Cumulated Volume}+\\text{Today&#39;s Diverted Discharge}\\) Create a scatter plot of historical salinity (as EC) collected from the site marked in the map (+) vs daily discharge from the drain (see sheet: Estuary – Salinity). Fit a trendline to the data and display equation and R2 – this is a statistical model. In a new time-series column in the previous sheet, use the statistical model from above to predict a salinity time-series for the above station in the estuary under the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Q2: Table of the number of days daily flow within the above bands and annual average number of days Q3: Table of the annual amount of flow in total and in each band Q4: Table of annual flow by year with index and probability. Scatter plot of the flow vs probability curve Q6: Table of the cumulative amount of diverted water Q7 &amp; 8: Scatterplot of the EC vs. daily discharge from the drain, with trendline (hint: exponential), equation and R2 value Q9: Plot of the salinity timeseries of the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case In less than 100 words, discuss which is the most appropriate scenario choice for management of the estuary These are in a word doc or PDF format.

["M2-1.html", "Module 2: Biogeochemistry", " Module 2: Biogeochemistry Bacterially Mediated Organic Matter Oxidation Rates Objectives Become familiar with basic spread sheet commands in excel by building a simple biogeochemical model from chemical and mathematical equations. Become familiar with the program R Studio and compare it to Excel. Modelling concepts This model has variables of concentration and rate, no spatial dimensions, and it has a dimension of time. Last week’s model had variables of volume and concentration (salinity), and was also resolved in time. In coming weeks the models will be resolved in zero, one, two or three dimensions of space, and only some will be resolved in time. Going down the rows of the Excel spread sheet means going forward in time, as the differential equations break the time axis into hundreds of tiny little chunks. The concentration at any point in time may depend on concentration at the previous point in time. We use the notation concentrationt depends on concentrationt-1. Organic matter oxidation Organic matter (dead algae, leaves etc.) is oxidised by different bacteria that use a range of oxidants. The bacteria simultaneously consume organic matter and an oxidant, in a similar way to how humans consume carbohydrate and oxygen. Scientists have observed that there is a general sequence of oxidants used, based on the energy available for each process. When all of the oxidants are consumed, methanogenesis takes place, where bacteria use the organic matter alone without any oxidant. This is similar to the lactic acid metabolic system that the human body uses when oxygen is in short supply, such as when you go for a run. Remember that methane is a reduced byproduct, not an oxidant. Other reduced by-products include N2 gas, Mn2+ and Fe2+ metal ions, and the S2- anion. We can construct a model to determine the rates at which the oxidation takes place, and use the rates to determine other processes such as oxygen consumption, denitrification or phosphate adsorption. The rate is dependent on the concentration of the organic matter, \\(\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\), and a rate constant, \\(\\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\). The rate is not dependent on the concentration of the oxidant, until the oxidant concentration becomes very low: this process is included as a limitation term (With more O2 you do not become super; with less O2 you get sleepy). A Monod equation is used to limit the rate. \\[\\begin{equation} R_{O_{2}} = \\color{#00B0F0}{K_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{O_{2}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] The generally observed sequence of oxidants is modelled with an inhibition process, so that a higher energy yielding oxidant, such as oxygen, inhibits a lower energy oxidant such as iron. \\[\\begin{align*} R_{NO_{3}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{NO_{3}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{2}\\\\ R_{Mn} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Mn}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{3}\\\\ R_{Fe} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Fe}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{4} \\\\ R_{SO_{4}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{SO_{4}^{2-}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{5}\\\\ R_{Meth} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{SO_{4}}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{6}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] In this lab, we simulate a blob of aquatic sediment. It is a closed system, so that the initial concentrations react until they reach equilibrium. This system is also perfectly mixed, with an unchanging biomass of bacteria, and so there is no spatial resolution. This allows us to focus on the chemical reactions alone. Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet and R scripts for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Exercises Building the model in Excel Looking at the sequence of equations above: what is the difference between the limitation and the inhibition term? Have a good think about this. If concentration were amazingly bigger or smaller than the \\(K_{O_{x}}\\)1, what would happen to the rates of the higher and lower energy processes? For example, with a high oxygen concentration, what would happen to the manganese reduction rate? With a low oxygen and nitrate concentration, and a high manganese concentration, what would happen to the manganese oxidation rate? Complete the excel spreadsheet for iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Oxygen, nitrate and manganese are done already, so copy the method and use the equations at the tops of the columns. It is tedious, fiddly and there is a good chance that you will introduce bugs that are hard to find. This is the nature of Excel. Video 1: Match your Excel equations to the formulas on the sheet (Tip: Make this video fullscreen for better viewing). The rate is dependent on the concentration in the previous time step – this is called an explicit solution (as opposed to implicit). Complete the line plot (1) of relative oxidant concentration for iron and sulphate. Right click on the plot and use ‘Add data’, make the x axis time and the y axis relative concentration. It is easy to visualise if you keep the colours consistent, and choose the colours that you like. Adjust the values for the initial condition and the half-saturation constants and see how the lines move on your plot. Add more time steps underneath if you want to see what happens over the long term. Complete the area plot (2) of reaction rates, then play around with the numbers to test the sensitivities of the outputs to the parameter inputs Building the model in R Now the excel spreadsheet is working, the next step is to repeat the process in R. Open the R project and the three scripts: there is one in which you set the input parameters and initial conditions; one which has the equations; and one which is used for plotting the outputs. Read through them and become familiar with what is in each. Run each script in sequence, starting with Inputs, then Equations, then Plotting. The plotting script should make a plot appear in the bottom right corner. You can press Cmd+Enter on MacOS, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows instead of clicking the ‘Run’ button. Enter the inputs, equations and plotting scripts for iron, sulfate and methanogenesis reactions, just as you did in the excel spreadsheet. Remember that you just need a rate of methanogenesis: methane is not an oxidant like sulfate. Step 1: Enter the inputs for Iron. Don’t forget to ‘run’ these! Step 2: Write the equation. It should match Equation (4). Step 3: Graph it and repeat previous steps for the other oxidants. In the Plotting script, uncomment (remove the #s) the lines starting with png and dev.off. Now if you run the plot (3) again, it saves the plot to a .png file. You can edit the settings of the png line to create a high quality figure to put in the report. Now we have a working process-based model. This was the hard and boring part, but now we can be creative. So far we have established an initial condition and let it run to completion, but next we can model a hypothetical environmental situation. For example, imagine there were an oxygen fluctuation, perhaps from algal photosynthesis occurring in the day but not at night in a lake, or from the tidal movement of hypoxic water. In either Excel or R, create a new environmental situation that involves organic matter oxidation. Consider the assumptions you are making and how important they are. Use the model to test the effect of this situation on concentrations and rates. For example, what would happen if there were regular organic matter deposition as a boundary condition? Or maybe what if there were a constant oxygen concentration? What conditions might be needed to minimise methanogenesis? How could you maximise denitrification? I will give higher marks if you do something original and creative. Write a brief description of your new situation and create one plot (4) to explain your result. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in Excel Graph of rate (y) against time (x) area plot, for all oxidants Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in R Any figure of a new environmental situation you create, and a brief explanation of lessthan 100 words of how you used the model creatively. These are in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable Where \\(K_{O_{x}}\\) is the general term for the half saturation constant of any oxidant, for example \\(K_{O_{2}}\\), \\(K_{SO_{4}}\\) etc.↩︎ "],
["M3-1.html", "Module 3: Climate Modeling", " Module 3: Climate Modeling Energy Balance Models Objectives To construct a simple energy balance climate model for the earth in Excel To understand the role of greenhouse gases, and incorporate them into an energy balance climate model Module resources There are no module resources needed for these exercises! Case Study 1: A “Zero-Dimensional” Energy Balance Model Here, we assume that the Earth is a sphere with uniform surface and no differences with latitude and longitude (i.e. everything receives the same amount of solar energy). We also assume that there is a balance, or equilibrium, between incoming short wavelength solar radiation absorbed by the ground and outgoing long wavelength radiation emitted by the ground. To simplify the model further, we assume the Earth emits outgoing (longwave) radiation like a “blackbody”, i.e. it is a perfectly efficient radiator - it gives off the maximum amount of radiation that an object of its temperature can emit. Outgoing Radiation The rate of the outgoing radiant energy (Joules per second = Watts) from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation: \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\sigma T^{4} \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(\\sigma\\) = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67x10-8), and \\(T\\) = Temperature (in degrees Kelvin). However, for the Earth, this is being emitted over the full surface area of the Earth: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{out}} = \\sigma 4\\pi r^{2} T^{4} \\tag{8} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(r\\) = Radius of the Earth (in m). Incoming Radiation The energy absorbed by the earth is given by the amount of incoming solar radiation which is not reflected due to albedo. However, we have to take into account that solar energy is striking the Earth as a parallel beam of circular cross-section. So this incoming beam of radiation hits only a single “disc” of the Earth’s surface at any one time. This area has a surface area \\(\\pi r^{2}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{abs}} = S\\pi r^{2} (1-a) \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(S\\) = incoming solar radiation: the “solar constant” (1367 W/m2) . Exercises Using the concept of an energy balance (i.e. energy in = energy out), rearrange the equations to find the Earth’s temperature, \\(T\\). In Excel, construct a simple spreadsheet and fill in the blank cells of Table 1 to calculate the mean temperature of the Earth using the equation from Q1, assuming an albedo of 0.33 (including in °C and °F): The current mean temperature of the Earth is 288K (15°C). Does this simple model over or under predict the Earth’s temperature? What important factor is missing from this model? Table 1: Fill in the blank cells to calculate the mean temperature of the Earth. Parameter Value Units Solar constant 1367 W/m2 Albedo 0.33 No Units Stefan-Boltzmann constant 5.67e-08 No Units Mean temperature of Earth K Mean temperature of Earth °C Mean temperature of Earth °F Remember: \\(K = °C + 273.2\\) and \\(°F = 1.8°C + 32\\) Test the sensitivity of this model to the choice of albedo. Using values from 0.3 to 0.7 in Table 2, calculate and plot T (°C) Table 2: Test the sensitivity of this model. Albedo Solar constant Assumed Albedo Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\(T\\) (˚C) 0.3 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 0.4 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 0.5 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 0.6 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 0.7 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 Case Study 2: A “Quick Fix” To try to reduce the error in the model estimates of Earth’s temperature, we can “parameterise” the model using observed or experimentally derived relationships between outgoing radiation and temperature. One such example is: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{out}} = x + yT \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(x = 204\\) W/m2, and \\(y = 2.17\\) W/m2/°C. This gets inputted into the energy balance equation (energy in = energy out) to give: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi r^{2} S (1-a) = 4\\pi r^{2}(X+yT) \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] Exercises Solve the above equation for \\(T\\) (note, this time, \\(T\\) is in CELSIUS!) Set up a spreadsheet to estimate \\(T\\) for a range of albedo values. Different amounts of glacial ice cover on the Earth could produce albedos from 0.3 for minimal ice to 0.7 for a complete ice cover (this might seem unrealistic, but geologists have recently found evidence to suggest that the Earth was completely ice-covered during Neoproterozoic time 700 million years ago – a “snowball Earth”!) Are your results reasonably close for the present-day Earth mean temperature? What is the sensitivity of this model to small changes in albedo? Expanding a bit from your model (you might need to consider smaller steps in albedo), at what value of albedo do you think this simplified Earth would experience strong positive feedback involving ice cover, albedo, and mean temperature, and therefore move rapidly toward “snowball Earth” with albedo = 0.7? Could it ever be deglaciated? Table 3: Estimate \\(T\\) for a range of albedo values. Albedo x y \\(T\\) (˚C) 0.3 204 2.17 0.4 204 2.17 0.5 204 2.17 0.6 204 2.17 0.7 204 2.17 Case Study 3: Incorporating Greenhouse Gases This model is a modification of the one described by Harte (1988). He showed that it is appropriate, based on the physics of radiation (as water is the major absolver of terrestrial radiation), to divide the Earth’s atmosphere into a lower layer (from the surface to 1.8km altitude, containing 20% of the air and 50% of the water vapour) and an upper layer (containing 80% of the air and 50% of the water vapour). This time we require three energy-balance equations: For the Earth-atmosphere system as a whole; For the upper layer of the atmosphere; For the lower layer of the atmosphere. In this model, all energy terms are expressed as long-term average fluxes, all temperatures are absolute. We assume that emissivity = 1 except at the surface, and (most importantly) that each of the three systems is in equilibrium. Table 4: Energy balance model of Earth’s atmosphere. Parameter Description Value \\(S_{\\text{av}}\\) Solar radiation intercepted by Earth (\\(=\\frac{S}{4}\\) where \\(S\\) is the solar constant of 1370Wm-2) 342.5 Wm-2 \\(W\\) Heat generated from nonrenewable energy sources (fossil fuels + nuclear) 0.021 Wm-2 \\(L\\) Average latent heat flux from the surface 80 Wm-2 \\(H\\) Average sensible heat flux at the surface 17 Wm-2 \\(\\sigma\\) Stefan-Boltzmann constant 5.67 x10-8 Wm-2 deg-4 \\(a_{p}\\) Planetary albedo 0.3 \\(k_{u}\\) Fraction of solar radiation absorbed in upper layer of atmosphere 0.18 \\(k_{l}\\) Fraction of solar radiation absorbed in upper lower of atmosphere 0.075 \\(\\varepsilon\\) Emissivity (= 1 - reflectivity): the fraction of the infrared radiation emitted by the surface that is absorbed in the atmosphere and then re-emitted 0.95 \\(F_{u}\\) Infrared flux from upper layer (use black-body equation) \\(\\varepsilon \\sigma T_{u}^{4}\\) \\(F_{l}\\) Infrared flux from lower layer (use black-body equation) \\(\\varepsilon \\sigma T_{l}^{4}\\) \\(F_{s}\\) Infrared flux from surface (use black-body equation) \\(\\varepsilon \\sigma T_{s}^{4}\\) Exercise 1 Using the chart above, draw the model yourself by hand, incorporating all fluxes. We can now formulate the three energy-balance equations needed: Energy-balance for the Earth-atmosphere system as a whole: Energy enters the Earth–atmosphere system from above at the rate \\(S\\) and from below at the rate \\(W\\) (heat generated from nonrenewable energy sources: nuclear and fossil fuels). Energy leaves these the system by three routes: Reflected solar radiation: \\(a_{p}S_{av}\\); Thermal radiation from the top of the atmosphere: \\(\\sigma T_{u}^{4}\\); and The portion of thermal radiation from the surface that is not absorbed in the atmosphere: \\((1 − \\varepsilon)\\sigma T_{s}^{4}\\). Here: \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the fraction of surface radiation absorbed in the atmosphere (emissivity), \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and, \\(T_{u}\\) is the surface temperature (absolute). Thus, the energy balance for the whole system is: \\[\\begin{equation} S + W = a_{p}S_{av} + \\sigma T_{u}^{4} + (1 − \\varepsilon)\\sigma T_{s}^{4} \\tag{12} \\end{equation}\\] Energy-balance for the upper layer of the atmosphere: The upper atmospheric layer absorbs a fraction, \\(k_{u}\\), of the solar radiation that strikes it and also receives: Energy radiated upward from the lower layer: \\(\\sigma T_{l}^{4}\\), and, One-half of the latent heat that accompanies evaporation from the surface (because this layer holds one-half the atmospheric water vapour): \\(0.5L\\). The upper layer loses energy by thermal radiation upward to outer space and downward to the lower layer. Thus, the energy balance for the upper layer is: \\[\\begin{equation} k_{u}S_{av} + \\sigma T_{l}^{4} + 0.5L = 2\\sigma T_{u}^{4} \\tag{13} \\end{equation}\\] Energy-balance for the lower layer of the atmosphere: Energy enters the lower atmospheric layer from above as absorption of a fraction, \\(k_{l}\\), of the solar radiation that enters it and as thermal radiation from the upper layer: \\(\\sigma T_{u}^{4}\\). From below, energy enters from: The absorbed portion of thermal radiation from the surface: \\(\\varepsilon \\sigma T_{s}^{4}\\); One-half the latent-heat flux from the surface: \\(0.5L\\); The sensible-heat flux from the surface, \\(H\\); and The anthropogenic heat flux: \\(W\\). Energy is lost from this layer by upward and downward radiation. The energy balance for the lower layer is therefore: \\[\\begin{equation} k_{l}S_{av} + \\sigma T_{u}^{4} + \\varepsilon \\sigma T_{s}^{4} + 0.5L + H + W = 2\\sigma T_{l}^{4} \\tag{14} \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2 Solve these equations to find a formula for surface temperature \\(T_{s}\\): Equations (12) to (14) are a system of three equations in three unknowns: the temperatures \\(T_{l}\\), \\(T_{u}\\), and \\(T_{s}\\). The other quantities are parameters whose values must be given. The values of temperatures can be found via the following steps: Rearrange Equation (12) for \\(\\sigma T_{u}^{4}\\) in terms of \\(T_{s}\\) and parameters. Rearrange Equation (13) for \\(\\sigma T_{l}^{4}\\) in terms of \\(T_{u}\\) and parameters. Substitute the results of step 1 into the results of step 2 to give an equation for \\(\\sigma T_{l}^{4}\\) in terms of \\(T_{s}\\) and parameters. Rearrange Equation (14) for \\(\\sigma T_{s}^{4}\\) in terms \\(T_{l}\\), \\(T_{u}\\), and parameters. Put the results of steps 1 and 3 into the results of step 4 and simplify to give the equation for \\(T_{s}\\) as a function of parameters: \\[\\begin{equation} T_{s} = [\\frac{(3-3a_{p}-2k_{u}-k_{l})S_{av}-1.5L-H+2W}{(3-2\\varepsilon)\\sigma}]^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\tag{15} \\end{equation}\\] Show your workings! Using the values given in Table 4, what value do you derive for \\(T_{s}\\)? How close is this to the actual value of 290K? Exercise 3 Using Excel, test the sensitivity of this model to albedo. Compare your findings to those found in Case Study 1 (a plot of \\(T_{s}\\) for values of albedo between 0.3 and 0.7 might help here). Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Clear photograph or page scan of your hand drawn conceptual model of the Harte 1-D Energy Balance Model, including key explaining the terms. Clear photograph or page scan of your handwritten workings of the Harte Model calculations, with a clear answer of \\(T_{s}\\), the Earth’s temperature. Summary plot from Exercise 1, 2 &amp; 3 assessing albedo and temperature of the three models, with a brief explanation of less than 150 words of which model you prefer.

["M4-1.html", "Module 4: Oceanic pH Calculation", " Module 4: Oceanic pH Calculation Objectives Calculate the carbonate species distribution given pH and CO2 (gas) Build a double-log plot based on a range of pHs Calculate the pH change and CaCO3 solubility given an increased atmospheric CO2. Replot other published data for comparison with our data Overview In this exercise, we create a simple model of the ocean, with a limited number of state variables. We examine the chemical interactions that result from atmospheric CO2 gas dissolving in water, along with calcium salts in the ocean fed by erosion of minerals on the land. The key overall process is that dissolved CO2 and Ca2+ are in equilibrium with solid CaCO3 (limestone). Figure 1: Bleached coral (foreground) and normal coral (background). CC BY 3.0, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=32829631 The major variables are given in Table 5. Given any two of the variables on the left hand column, the other four can be calculated.

You can use either Excel or R for this module. Exercise 1 In the first exercise, we set pH to be 8.3 and atmospheric CO2 gas to be 3.5×10-4 atmospheres, and calculate the other variables based on these two. CO2 gas dissolves in water according to Equation (16). The dissolved CO2 easily dissociates into carbonic acid according to Equation (17). For simplicity, we will go straight from atmospheric CO2 to H2CO3*, which is the sum of dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid, using Equation (18). \\[\\begin{align*} {CO}_{2(\\text{gas})}&amp;\\rightleftarrows{CO}_{2(\\text{dissolved})} \\tag{16} \\\\ {CO}_{2(\\text{dissolved})}+H_2O&amp;\\rightleftarrows H_2{CO}_3 \\tag{17} \\\\ {CO}_{2(\\text{gas})}+H_2O&amp;\\rightleftarrows \\color{#ED7D31}{H_2CO_3^\\ast} \\hspace{3em} K_{H} = 3.39×10^{-2} \\tag{18} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The carbonic acid dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H+, or proton) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), according to Equation (19). The bicarbonate further dissociates into carbonate (CO32-) and another hydrogen ion, as shown in Equation (20). The release of these two hydrogen ions is what creates the acidity of the ocean. \\[\\begin{align*} \\color{#ED7D31}{H_2CO_3^\\ast} &amp;\\rightleftarrows \\color{#00B050}{HCO_3^-}+\\color{#FF0000}{H^+} \\hspace{3em} K_{1} = 5×10^{-7} \\tag{19} \\\\ \\color{#00B050}{HCO_3^{-}} &amp;\\rightleftarrows \\color{#5B9BD5}{{CO}_3^{2-}}+\\color{#FF0000}{H^+} \\hspace{3em} K_{2} = 5×10^{-11} \\tag{20} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Total carbon, \\(C_{T}\\), is defined as the sum of these carbonate species. Alkalinity is defined as the sum of the charged carbonate species and the balance of hydrogen ions and hydroxide (OH-), as shown in Equations (21) and (22). (Remember that alkalinity is the opposite of acidity.) \\[\\begin{align*} C_T&amp;=\\left[\\color{#00B050}{{HCO}_3^-}\\right]+\\left[\\color{#5B9BD5}{{CO}_3^{2-}}\\right]+\\left[\\color{#ED7D31}{H_2{CO}_3^\\ast}\\right] \\tag{21} \\\\ \\left[Alk\\right]&amp;=\\left[\\color{#00B050}{{HCO}_3^-}\\right]+2\\left[\\color{#5B9BD5}{{CO}_3^{2-}}\\right]+\\left[{OH}^-\\right]-\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right] \\tag{22} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The concentration of hydroxide can be found by rearranging Equation (23) to Equation (24) and using the dissociation constant of water, \\(K_W\\), and the hydrogen ion concentration. \\[\\begin{align*} [OH^{-}][\\color{#FF0000}{H^{+}}] &amp;= K_{W} \\hspace{3em} K_{W} = 1×10^{-14} \\tag{23} \\\\ [OH^{-}]&amp;=\\frac{K_{W}}{[\\color{#FF0000}{H^{+}]}} \\tag{24} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Open the Excel spreadsheet or R project and examine the tab or script Initial CO2. The chemical equations and constants are given to you already. The variables that we are forcing to be constant in Excel are coloured grey. Enter the equations for Exercise 1 into the yellow boxes. If we assume that calcium ion concentration does not vary much in this system, we can force it to be 5×10-4 mol L-1. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation or dissolution is governed by the ratio (\\(\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\)) of Ca2+ concentration and CO32- concentration to the solubility constant, \\(K_{sp}\\), according to Equations (25) and (26). If is greater than 1, then precipitation is favourable, and conversely, if is less than 1, dissolution is favourable. \\[\\begin{align*} {CO}_3^{2-} &amp;+{Ca}^{2+}\\rightleftarrows CaCO_3 \\hspace{3em} K_{sp} = 1\\times 10^{-8.4} \\tag{25} \\\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega} &amp;=\\frac{[Ca^{2+}][CO_{3}^{2-}]}{[K_{sp\\space CaCO_{3}}]} \\tag{26} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Have a good think about this: given these CO2 and pH, did your calculations lead to a system that favours CaCO3 dissolution or precipitation? Exercise 2 In this exercise you will construct a double-logarithmic plot of this system, holding CO2 constant and varying the pH. Go to the second tab in Excel and copy the equations over from the first tab. Or in R, you can run a for loop to calculate the different concentrations for each of the different pHs. Then you will have some of the major variables converted to logarithms. Next you can make an x y scatter plot. If you add the data correctly, you should get a plot that looks like Figure 2. Figure 2: Double logarithmic plot of the equilibrium composition of seawater in our model (Stumm and Morgan 1996) Exercise 3 This is the cool part. Here we are going to calculate a new pH given an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. Given that we calculated the concentrations of all the other species according to the initial distribution in Exercise 1, we now hold them all constant, while increasing CO2 and calculating H+ (and therefore pH). This is not simple, because H+ concentration is tightly bound up with the concentrations of all other species, and so we cannot simply work backwards from any one equation alone. However, there is a quadratic Equation (27) that we can solve for H+ , using a fixed \\(C_{T}\\), rearranged to Equation (28). \\[\\begin{align*} {\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right]^2C}_T &amp;=\\color{#ED7D31}{H_2{CO}_3^\\ast}\\left(\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right]^2+K_1\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right]+K_1K_2\\right) \\tag{27} \\\\ \\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right] &amp;=\\sqrt[2]{\\frac{\\color{#ED7D31}{H_2{CO}_3^\\ast}}{C_T}\\left(\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right]^2+K_1\\left[\\color{#FF0000}{H^+}\\right]+K_1K_2\\right)} \\tag{28} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Solving this quadratic would be fiendishly difficult. Instead, we will use trial and error, otherwise known as our iterative solution. We will do this to find a value for H+ that is the same on both sides of the equation. Go to the third tab and copy over all of the equations from Exercise 1. The grey boxes are the values that we will hold constant, and the first guess for H+, based on the H+ in Exercise 1. You can alter the CO2 concentration using the CO2 multiplier cell and your rapidly developing Excel and R skills. If you want to double CO2 concentration, type 2 into the multiplier cell. If you want to keep it at present levels, type 1. Repeat the calculation of Equation (28) over successive iterations, using the answer from the previous iteration as your guess for the next iteration. Eventually, the difference between your guesses will become very small and you can settle on a constant pH. (This is roughly how equilibrium-solving computer programs solve complex biogeochemical interactions, often with many more interacting variables than this.) Don’t forget that your successive iterations, are not time steps, like we had in previous weeks. Rather, they are just guesses at the right number that only exist in the model. Your final answer is the only one that has a real scientific meaning. If you want to determine the pH over a range of CO2 concentrations, you will need to repeat the calculation over ~10 rows, and save your results each time. Big questions: if you increase CO2, does the pH rise or fall? Does CaCO3 precipitation become more or less favourable if CO2 increases? Exercise 4 Last exercise! In this exercise, we will extract someone else’s data from their plot and make our own plot. Go to the IPCC website and read about CO2 predictions and CaCO3 precipitation. Save their Figure 10.24 as an image file or download it here. Figure 3: Changes in global average surface pH and saturation state with respect to aragonite in the Southern Ocean under various SRES scenarios. Go to the Plot Digitizer website and download the program. Open the IPCC image in Plot Digitizer. The program guides you through the steps you need to take: read the command at the bottom of the screen (for example, “Choose most negative end of x-axis”) and click “Done” when you have finished. It will be easiest if you make a point every 10 years. Save each dataset as a separate csv file and then combine the results in one sheet. If your x-axis points line up nicely enough, you can re-plot the data. Compare these results with your own results. And make any plots that you feel help explain the environmental system behaviour. Which factors cause the differences between your results and those of the IPCC models? Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Double log plot.

["M5-1.html", "Module 5: Catchment Water Balance Submission", " Module 5: Catchment Water Balance Objectives To understand a simple multi-store catchment water balance model and implement within Excel or R. Using the supplied parameters and input data, run the model and plot the variability in key hydrological pathways. The Water Balance Approach A water balance equation can be used to describe the flow of water in and out of a “system”. A system can be one of several hydrological domains depending on the context, such as a column of soil or a catchment basin. In the context of catchment, we assume the catchment area has a known ‘average’ depth, and the amount of soil is the catchment area multiplied by the depth. We treat this soil volume as our catchment ‘bucket’, and then estimate the inputs (rainfall) and outputs (evapotranspiration, runoff and baseflow). Based on our understanding of soil physics, flow processes and transpiration, we can further partition water within the bucket into different sub-compartments. In this exercise we assume the catchment bucket can include a saturated and unsaturated layer, and even an optional deeper groundwater system. The water balance assumes an initial amount of water and then we sequentially estimate the fluxes of water as outlined below in the conceptual diagram. Figure 4: Conceptual model schematic of the 0D ‘bucket’ by Yasmina Elshafei and Matthew Hipsey, adapted from Farmer et al. (2003) Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet and R files for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . You can use either Excel or R for this module. Water Balance Model Open the spreadsheet or RStudio project. Make sure that there are three sections in each: Inputs, Equations and Plotting. Draw your own version of the diagram above, label all of the variables and note the storage, evaporation and flows. Date Have a quick look at the date. In Excel, the date takes the first four columns of the Equations sheet. In RStudio, there is a section in the Inputs script called #DATE. Run the section line by line and you will learn how to make dates. Then delete the comments at the end of the section. Climate As boundary conditions, we have a precipitation dataset, and a function (Equation (50)) to simulate potential evaporation (Figure 5). In Excel, the precipitation is in a column and has a value for every date. The potential evaporation is given by a sin wave function that makes potential evaporation increase in summer and decrease in winter. Copy this formula down the page. In RStudio, the rainfall is given by a text file ’Precipitation.txt’. You will have to download this text file, tell RStudio the location where you have saved the data, and then load the data into your project. Finally, in the equations, you can convert the precipitation dataset into a matrix. The parameters for the potential evaporation function are in Inputs, and the equation is in the Equations script. Look for the #CLIMATE FORCING sections. Figure 5: Potential evaporation sin wave function over time. Storage Start to write in the equations for storage, using the equations given in the Equations section of this module. Note that there are two variables that have a prime (\\(\\prime\\)) sign. These variables only exist theoretically in the model, so that we can use them for our IF statements. You may have to convert between storage volumes (m3) and heights (m) by multiplying or dividing by area (m2). In Excel, there is an initial condition in a box given for you at time step 0. Your equations will start at time step 1. Your whole set of equations will not be finished until you have also completed the evaporation and flows, but you have to start somewhere. In RStudio, the initial condition is given in the Inputs section with the square brackets and the [1] (time step 1) and the loop starts at time step 2. For the equations, use the sequence that is given. The code reads from top to bottom so it is important that if a variable is referred to in an equation, it must already have been calculated in a previous line of code. Pay careful attention to the indices for \\(t\\) and \\(t-1\\). In Excel, the timestep advances as you go down the page. The notation \\(t\\) could refer to any timestep, with \\(t-1\\) simply being the timestep before \\(t\\), and \\(t+1\\) being the timestep after \\(t\\). If an equation is written entirely in terms of \\(t+1\\) (e.g. \\(X^{t+1}= Y^{t+1}+Z^{t+1}\\)), it can be simplified to be written just in terms of \\(t\\) (e.g. \\(X^{t}= Y^{t}+Z^{t}\\)). This is because \\(t\\) is arbitrary and we’re just referring to the same timestep for the entire equation. Evapotranspiration Type in the evapotranspiration equations. Use the previous time step storage values to calculate these. Flows Type in the flow equations. Plots When you have finished filling in all the columns, see the Submission section for what plots to create and submit.

Note that \\(S_{max}\\) is the sum of \\(S_{us}\\) and \\(S_{sat}\\), and does not include \\(S_{gw}\\). Note that ‘plant available water’ is the water content difference between field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil at any given depth. Threshold Storage Already completed in INPUTS \\[\\begin{equation} f_c=\\ \\left(\\frac{\\theta_{fc}-\\ \\theta_{pwp}}{\\varphi-\\ \\theta_{pwp}}\\right) \\tag{30} \\end{equation}\\] Field capacity is the point at which all pore space small enough to retain water against the pull of gravity are filled (Brady and Weil, 1999). It is essentially the remaining water content of the soil after the removal of water by the downward forces of gravity over a daily time period. Field capacity therefore assumes that the water removed from the soil profile is only removed by gravity, not through plant suction or evaporation. The above formula calculates the threshold storage parameter as the proportion of ‘plant available water’ over storage capacity of the soil at any given depth. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{fc}=\\ S_{max} f_c \\tag{31} \\end{equation}\\] The volumetric water storage at field capacity is therefore the theoretical maximum storage capacity of the catchment multiplied (or limited by) the threshold storage parameter (which is ≤ 1). Water Balance \\[\\begin{equation} S_{tot}^{t+1}= S_{tot}^{t}+(P^{t+1}- e_{tot}^{t+1})A_{c} - Q_{tot}^{t+1} \\tag{32} \\end{equation}\\] Water storage at any given time step, \\(t\\), is calculated using the previous time step’s water storage as a starting point (\\(t\\)). Inflows and outflows of water from the system/ bucket are then incorporated to obtain the next consecutive value of \\(S\\). Precipitation recorded in the previous time step (inflow) is added to the initial storage value, whilst total evapotranspiration and total runoff in the previous time step (outflows) are both subtracted. Total water storage is made up of water stored in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Note that the initial value of \\(S_{tot}\\) may be empirically determined or assumed to be a certain value. The initial value of \\(S_{sat}\\) is taken to be \\(D\\) less the depth from the surface to the water table, which can be measured. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{us}^{t+1}=\\ S_{tot}^{t+1^\\prime}-\\ S_{sat}^{t+1} \\tag{33} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} S_{us(fc)}^{t+1}=\\ f_c\\left(S_{max}-\\ S_{sat}^t\\right) \\tag{34} \\end{equation}\\] Threshold storage in the unsaturated zone is simply the maximum potential storage capacity in the unsaturated zone multiplied (limited) by the threshold storage parameter. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{us}^{t+1^\\prime}=\\ S_{us}^t+\\ P^{t+1} A_{c} \\tag{35} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} R_p^{t+1}=\\ S_{us}^{{t+1}^\\prime}-\\ S_{us(fc)}^{t+1} , \\text{if}\\ \\ \\ S_{us}^{{t+1}^\\prime}&gt;\\ S_{us(fc)}^{t+1} \\tag{36} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (36) is an IF Statement. The daily recharge rate from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone is calculated as water storage in the unsaturated zone in the present time step, in addition to precipitation that has occurred in the current time step, less the threshold storage of the unsaturated zone (i.e. water which does not drain due to the downward forces of gravity alone). Recharge of this nature only occurs in the event that the combination of precipitation in the current time step and water storage in the unsaturated zone in the present time step is greater than the threshold field capacity of the unsaturated zone. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{sat}^{t+1}=\\ S_{sat}^t+\\ R_p^{t+1}-\\ R_g^{t+1}-\\ Q_{ss}^{t+1}-\\ e_{v}^{t+1}A_{c} \\tag{37} \\end{equation}\\] Note the use of “\\(t+1\\)” on the Right Hand Side for \\(R\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(e\\) will be on the same row since they are computed based on yesterday’s \\(S\\). The balance of volumetric water storage in the saturated zone is therefore calculated as the previous period’s storage plus any recharge from the unsaturated zone, less outflows including recharge to groundwater, subsurface runoff, and total evapotranspiration (bare soil, deep rooted vegetation and agricultural crop) from the saturated zone. Optional Deep Ground Water Store: \\[\\begin{equation} R_g^{t+1}=\\ K_s{S}_{sat}^t \\tag{38} \\end{equation}\\] Daily recharge to groundwater is calculated as the saturated hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the present water storage in the saturated zone. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{gw}^{t+1}=\\ S_{gw}^t+\\ R_g^{t+1}-\\ Q_{bf}^{t+1}\\ \\tag{39} \\end{equation}\\] The balance of volumetric groundwater storage is calculated as the previous period’s storage plus recharge from the saturated zone less base flow out of the catchment. \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{bf}^{t+1}= \\alpha_{bf} (\\frac{S_{gw}^t}{S_{gw\\ max}})^{\\beta_{bf}} \\tag{40} \\end{equation}\\] Base flow is treated for our purposes as a nonlinear function using groundwater storage. Transpiration \\[\\begin{equation} e_{tot}^t=\\ e_v^t+\\ e_{bs}^t+\\ e_{ag}^t \\tag{41} \\end{equation}\\] Total evapotranspiration (ET) of the system is the sum of ET from deep rooted native vegetation, bare soil and agricultural crops in the catchment. Native vegetation ET is calculated as follows. Simple form: \\[\\begin{equation} e_v^{t+1}= M (\\frac{S_{tot}^t}{S_{max}})^\\varepsilon k_v e_p^{t+1} \\tag{42} \\end{equation}\\] Agricultural/Shallow Root Crop Evapotranspiration For evapotranspiration by agricultural crops, we make the assumption that they can draw water from the unsaturated zone only, thus: \\[\\begin{equation} e_{ag}^{t+1}=C \\alpha_{eag}[\\frac{S_{us}^t}{S_{max}-S_{sat}^t}]e_{p}^{t+1} \\tag{43} \\end{equation}\\] Bare Soil Evaporation \\[\\begin{equation} e_{bs}^{t+1} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} (1-M-C)\\alpha_{ebs}\\left[\\frac{S_{us}^t}{S_{max}-\\ S_{sat}^t}\\right]e_p^{t+1},\\ \\ &amp;S_{sat}^t&lt;\\varphi D_{ebs} A_c \\\\ (1-M-C)\\alpha_{ebs}\\left[\\frac{S_{us}^{t}+\\ \\left(S_{us}^{t}-\\ \\varphi D_{ebs}\\right)}{S_{sat}^t-\\ \\varphi D_{ebs}}\\right]e_p^{t+1},\\ \\ &amp;S_{sat}^t\\geq\\varphi D_{ebs} A_c \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{44} \\end{equation}\\] This is an IF statement. In Excel split this equation up into the ‘TRUE’ and ‘FALSE’ columns. Calculating Daily \\(e_p\\) Daily potential evaporation will be calculated using a sine wave, as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} e_{p(\\text{daily})}=\\ \\frac{e_{p(\\text{annual})}}{365}\\left[1+A\\ \\textbf{sin}\\left\\{B\\left(m-1\\right)+d\\right\\}+C\\right]\\ \\tag{45} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(A_{sin}\\) is the height of the sine wave (i.e. maximum less minimum value), \\(B\\) is the frequency of the sine wave, \\(C\\) is the minimum \\(e_{p(\\text{daily})}\\) (i.e. in mid-winter), \\(d\\) is the day of the month, and \\(m\\) is the month number. Flows \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{tot}^t = Q_{se}^t + Q_{ie}^t + Q_{ss}^t \\tag{46} \\end{equation}\\] Total runoff of the system is the sum of saturation excess, infiltration excess, subsurface runoff, and (optional) base flow. \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{se}^t = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} {S}_{tot}^{t \\prime}-\\ S_{max}^t,\\ \\ &amp;{S}_{tot}^{t \\prime}&gt;S_{max} \\\\ 0,\\ \\ &amp;{S}_{tot}^{t \\prime}\\le S_{max} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{47} \\end{equation}\\] Saturation excess is simply taken as being zero to the extent that water storage in the bucket/ catchment is less than maximum storage capacity. In the event that total water storage exceeds maximum capacity however, any excess is taken to be surface runoff. \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{ie}^t = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} (P^t-I_{max})A_C,\\ \\ &amp;{P^t}&gt; I_{max} \\\\ 0,\\ \\ &amp;{P^t}\\le I_{max} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{48} \\end{equation}\\] Hortonian runoff (infiltration excess): \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{ss}^{t+1} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} 0,\\ \\ &amp;S_{sat}^{t}\\le S_{usfc}^{t+1} \\\\ \\alpha_{s}\\left(\\frac{S_{sat}^t}{S_{max}}\\right)^{\\beta s,}\\ \\ &amp;S_{usfc}^{t+1} &lt;\\ S_{sat}^t \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{49} \\end{equation}\\] Subsurface runoff is taken to be zero in cases where the total water storage is less than field capacity threshold (i.e. thus will not drain due solely to the forces of gravity). In the event that total storage in the bucket/ catchment is greater than threshold storage and less than maximum storage capacity, subsurface runoff is taken as a nonlinear function using the excess above threshold storage and the assigned recession coefficients.

Model Overview Consider a catchment basin with 3 sub catchments, each with a different dominant land use and slightly different climate. The daily runoff from each sub catchment, \\(Q_i\\) (m3/day), can be simply approximated based on the daily rainfall (\\(R\\)), where \\(c\\) is the daily runoff efficiency and \\(R^{crit}\\) is the initial loss threshold (\\(m\\), this is the amount of rainfall that does not make it to the stream): \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{i}^{t} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} 0,\\ \\ &amp;R_{i}^{t}\\le R_{i}^{crit} \\\\ c_{i}(R_{i}^{t}-R_{i}^{crit})A_{i},\\ \\ &amp;R_{i}^{t}&gt; R_{i}^{crit} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{51} \\end{equation}\\] The total flow (\\(Q_{tot}\\), m3/day) is calculated by summing the individual sub catchments, however there is an assumed lag time of 1 day for sub catchment 2 and 2 days lag time for sub catchment 3: \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{tot}^{t} = \\color{#9BBB59}{Q_{1}^{t}} + \\color{#0070C0}{Q_{2}^{t-1}} + \\color{#F79646}{Q_{3}^{t-2}} \\tag{52} \\end{equation}\\] For each sub catchment, the phosphorus concentration, \\(P_{i}\\) (g/m3), depends on how much flow there is (e.g. more flow = more fertilizer leaching) by assuming a simple power law fitted to the flow-concentration relationship computed for each land-use (\\(P\\)~\\(\\alpha Q \\beta\\)). This is averaged over the different land use fractions (denoted with the small \\(p\\) index), using the land-use fraction \\(F_p\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P_{i}^{t} = \\sum_{p=4}^{N_{p}} F_{p}\\left (\\color{#FF0000}{\\alpha_{p} \\left (\\frac{Q_{i}^{t}}{A_{i}} \\right )^{\\beta_{p}}+P_{0}} \\right ) \\tag{53} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\color{#FF0000}{\\alpha_{p} \\left (\\frac{Q_{i}^{t}}{A_{i}} \\right )^{\\beta_{p}}+P_{0}}\\) is the flow dependent concentration of the p-th land use type. Where alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and beta (\\(\\beta\\)) are variables that govern the stream \\(P_i\\) concentration (g/m3) as a function of area-averaged flow rate (\\(Q/A\\)) and they depend on the dominant land use (\\(p\\)). \\(N_p\\) is the number of land use classes being considered (4) and \\(P_0\\) is the background concentration (g/m3) for that sub-catchment (i.e. the value of PO4 when flow tends to 0). The total \\(P\\) export load is \\(P_{load}\\) (g/day) and is the sum of the different sub catchment outputs (remember load = flow x concentration) with the assumed lag time: \\[\\begin{equation} P_{load}^{t} = \\color{#9BBB59}{P_{1}^{t} Q_{1}^{t}} + \\color{#0070C0}{P_{2}^{t-1} Q_{2}^{t-1}} + \\color{#F79646}{P_{3}^{t-2} Q_{3}^{t-2}} \\tag{54} \\end{equation}\\] Module Resources Download the Excel spreadsheet for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Exercises Building the model Draw by hand the conceptual model of this system. Confirm with the person beside you what index means (\\(t\\), \\(i\\), \\(p\\)). Build the above model to predict the individual sub catchment flows and basin total flow. Assume basic information as outlined in Table 6 below and supplied rainfall data for the 3 catchments. Input a value for \\(c\\) within the range given for now. Table 6: Parameters for the individual catchments. Parameters for catchment model: Sub Catchment 1 (\\(i\\)=1) Sub Catchment 2 (\\(i\\)=2) Sub catchment 3 (\\(i\\)=3) Sub catchment area, \\(A\\) (km2) 50 100 120 Runoff coefficient, \\(c\\) (range) 0.2 to 0.5 0.1 to 0.4 0.1 to 0.3 Initial loss threshold value, \\(R_{crit}\\) (m) 0.01 0.025 0.04 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): irrigated dairy 0.1 0 0.5 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): wheat 0 0.8 0.1 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): urban 0.3 0 0.1 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): forest 0.6 0.2 0.3 Calibrating the model Let’s make sure the model flows are realistic: Manually adjust the runoff coefficient values (\\(c\\)) for each sub catchment (see possible ranges in table below) until the model best matches the observed data. This processed is called “calibration”. Check this by using a regression plot of the given total observed runoff and the model total runoff, checking to get the highest R2 value Calculate phosphate concentrations Now let’s work out the land-use specific stream \\(P\\) concentrations: Predict the sub catchment river \\(P\\) concentrations and total river basin \\(P\\) export load. The best way to do this is first predict the \\(P\\) concentration of each land-use class (\\(F_p\\)) in each sub catchment each as a column (i.e. Dairy \\(P\\) concentration, Wheat \\(P\\) concentration and so on), and then sum the 4 columns for \\(P_i\\). Table 7: Phosphate parameters. Parameters for P concentration: \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) \\(\\beta\\) (beta) Landuse parameters: irrigated dairy (\\(p\\)=1) 0.10 0.10 Landuse parameters: wheat (\\(p\\)=2) 0.05 0.15 Landuse parameters: urban (\\(p\\)=3) 0.06 0.15 Landuse parameters: forest (\\(p\\)=4) 0.02 0.08 See how dairy has the highest alpha? This means it produces the most \\(P\\) of all 4 classes. Consider 2 management scenarios Finally, let’s run 2 management scenarios: Scenario 1: If the total urban area in each sub catchment expands to 50% (0.5), how would this affect the overall \\(P\\) export? Change the land use fractions manually. They still have to add up to 1, so change the other parts as you see appropriate, i.e. urban area usually comes at the expense of forest, but you can decide how to change the landscape. Record your changed fractions. Scenario 2 If the irrigated dairy industry were made to contain their flows (i.e. prevent high \\(P\\) concentrations going to the stream), how would this affect the overall concentration in the water at the river basin outlet? They have to keep the total subcatchment \\(P\\) concentration below 0.065 g m3. Use an IF statement.

No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable "],
["M7-1.html", "Module 7: Advection-Dispersion", " Module 7: Advection-Dispersion Objectives To setup an advection-dispersion-reaction equation for a river system to demonstrate the combination of temporal and spatial finite differencing, in one dimension. Advection-Dispersion Reaction The advection-dispersion reaction equation for a species \\(C\\), is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\delta C}{\\delta t} = D_{d}\\frac{\\delta^{2} C}{\\delta x^{2}} - u \\frac{\\delta C}{\\delta x} + S + R \\tag{55} \\end{equation}\\] Where the left hand side (LHS) is the “unsteady” term (\\(C\\) change in time), the first term on the right hand side (RHS) is the dispersion/mixing term, the second term on the RHS is the advection/movement term and \\(S\\) is a source term and \\(R\\) is a reaction term. We use a partial deriviative (“curly \\(\\delta\\)”) since \\(C\\) is now varying in both space and time. In this exercise we numerically solve the 1-dimensional, advective-dispersive transport of oxygen in a river. To solve this equation numerically, we must “discretise” the partial derivatives using finite difference methods, here done according to the FTCS scheme (refer to lecture!): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{C^{t+1}_{x}-C^{t}_{x}}{\\Delta t}=D_{d} \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-2C_{x}^{t}+C_{x-1}^{t}}{\\Delta x^{2}}-u_{x}^{t} \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-C_{x-1}^{t}}{2\\Delta x}+R_{x}+S_{x} \\tag{56} \\end{equation}\\] Where the \\(t\\) subscript is referring to timestep, and the \\(x\\) subscript refers to the space increment/position. For the case of oxygen we assume that \\(R\\) is accounting for oxygen input from the atmosphere and consumption by bacteria (called the Biochemical Oxygen Demand, BOD), then: \\[\\begin{equation} R_x=k_a\\left(C_a-C_x^t\\right)-k_{BOD}C_x^t \\tag{57} \\end{equation}\\] Where the first term is atmospheric exchange (\\(k_a\\) is the rate of re-aeration and \\(C_a\\) is the saturation value of oxygen) and the second term is the bacterial consumption (described by \\(k_{BOD}\\) which is in units of day-1). We can solve for the forward timestep at any position along the river by computing: \\[\\begin{equation} \\small{C_{x}^{t+1}=\\color{#898989}{C_{x}^{t}}+ \\left [ \\color{#3A88FE}{D_d \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-2C_{x}^{t}+C_{x-1}^{t}}{\\Delta x^{2}}}-\\color{#FF2600}{u_{x}^{t} \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-C_{x-1}^{t}}{2\\Delta x}} + \\color{#77BB41}{k_{a}(C_{a}-C_{x}^{t})}-\\color{#B18CFE}{k_{BOD}C_{x}} \\right ]\\Delta t+\\color{#D58400}{S_{x}}} \\tag{58} \\end{equation}\\] Previous \\(C\\) concentration: \\(\\color{#898989}{C_{x}^{t}}\\) Diffusion: \\(\\color{#3A88FE}{D_d \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-2C_{x}^{t}+C_{x-1}^{t}}{\\Delta x^{2}}}\\) Advection: \\(\\color{#FF2600}{u_{x}^{t} \\frac{C_{x+1}^{t}-C_{x-1}^{t}}{2\\Delta x}}\\) Atmospherical exchange: \\(\\color{#77BB41}{k_{a}(C_{a}-C_{x}^{t})}\\) Biological O2 demand: \\(\\color{#B18CFE}{k_{BOD}C_{x}^{t}}\\) O2 source/sink: \\(\\color{#D58400}{S_{x}}\\) To solve this the user specifies the initial oxygen concentration (\\(C_0\\)), river velocity (\\(u\\)) as a function of distance, grid length (\\(L\\)), grid spacing (\\(\\Delta x\\)), simulation period (\\(T\\)), time step (\\(\\Delta t\\)). The calculation should then compute the change in oxygen as a function of distance and time. Extra sources or sinks of oxygen can by added into the domain based on the \\(S\\) term. We will first set up the model to have no \\(S\\) inputs along the side of the river, but in the last task we add a low oxygen discharge somewhere along the river (ie. a pipe outflow). Module Resources Download the Excel spreadsheet and R files for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar . You can use either Excel or R for this module. Exercises Setting up the Model Draw the schematic of the conceptual model by hand, showing the spatial discretisation, boundaries, sources, reactions, and a little animal swimming in the river. Start with the provided spreadsheet or R script, and implement the above expression. Set up the spreadsheet to assume a river of length (\\(L\\)) ~5 km. You will need to select an \\(x\\) increment (\\(\\Delta x\\)). In Excel, time is going down the rows and distance (space) is going along the columns. Set the initial condition (\\(C_0\\)) row to be 10 mg O2/L – i.e. the whole river starts at 10 mg/L in each cell. Once you see the formula is working in the first time-step, then copy the formula along the length of the river. You will need to set a downstream boundary condition (at the the position where \\(x = L\\), the last column). For this we will set a “zero-derivative” condition \\(– \\frac{\\delta C}{\\delta x} = 0\\). Therefore \\(C_n = C_{n-1}\\), where \\(n\\) is the last cell of the river length. Copy the first time row down for all the time-steps (simulate several days in total). Plot the oxygen concentration as a function of distance for several times during the simulation. Modelling a Wastewater Plume Implement at \\(x \\approx 1500\\text{m}\\) a wastewater plume entering the river – do this by reducing the \\(C\\) at the relevant \\(x\\) cell by 3 mg/L (or less if the \\(C\\) is already below 3). This is done by adding the extra “\\(S\\)” term of -3 to the appropriate \\(x\\)-cell formula, and copying the formula down through time. Plot and note how the oxygen recovers downstream of the low oxygen inflow plume. Use an IF statement. O2 concentration cannot be negative, so set a minimum concentration of 0 mg/L Figure 6: Advection and dispersion of O2 in a river of length \\(x\\). Note, in this figure \\(W_c\\) refers to our wastewater plume (click here for image source). Modelling an O2 Drop Change the upstream boundary concentration at \\(x = 0\\), to include a sudden drop in oxygen for a period of 0.5 hour. Plot how this signal propagates through the river domain during and after the period where the upstream condition drops – can you see the low oxygen pulse moving through the river? How does this concentration profile vary if the diffusivity is different? Modelling your own Scenario Create your own environmental scenario using this model, make a brief description of it, calculate a result and if necessary, express the result with a figure. If you see fluctuating negative and positive concentrations, you might have numerical instability. Adjust your \\(\\Delta t\\) or \\(\\Delta x\\). Figure 7: A plume of coloured dye dispersing through a river. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Clear photograph or page scan of your hand drawn conceptual model of the river with all the oxygen transport processes labelled. A plot of oxygen concentration at several times plotted for all distance of the river. A plot of oxygen concentration at several points of the river plotted for all time. A plot of the oxygen concentration with the upstream boundary drop at several points of the river plotted for all time. A plot of the oxygen concentration with the wastewater plume at several times plotted for all distance of the river. A plot of your own individual environmental scenario. Don’t plot too many lines – only several are necessary and use your judgement to select how many show the results well whilst the plot still clear and easy to understand. Make sure your axes are well labelled and clear to read. If abbreviating oxygen, include a subscript in O2. These are in a word doc or PDF format.
