What is an environmental flow? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity Case study Figure 1: Drain L inflows (yellow arrow) will be diverted (blue arrow) Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet: MODULE01_EnvFlowData.xls Exercises You are given a time-series of daily river flow and need to assess how different diversion scenarios impact the freshwater flow delivery to a down stream estuary. For this flow time-series, calculate the volume of daily flow within the following bands 0-40; 40-80; 80-120; 120-200; 200-400; 400-1000; &gt;1000 Use Nested “IF” statement in adjacent columns to partition flows For this flow time-series, calculate the number of days daily flow within the above bands and work out annual average number of days Use COUNT() to get the number of entries in the column Calculate the annual amount of flow in total and in each band You may do the annual averaging manually or the pivot table method. For the pivot table method: Insert a new column B, Label it Year. Type the year number into the first cell, make sure it is formatted as a number. Use YEAR() to speed this step up Click two times on the little square in the corner of the box. This will fill down the page. Repeat this at each year change and you will have the year only information which you can then use to summarise data. As the original date has day numbers and decimal time each one is unique so you end up with a record for each day. This way you get a record for each year. Highlight all the data. It must have headings for each column or it won’t work. Go to “Insert” then “Pivot Table”. Click OK as you want the default settings. Then you just fiddle until you get what you want. The following is an example: Sort the years from highest to lowest flow: Add a new column next to the flows indexing the years sequentially Add a new column next to the indices calculating the probability of meeting the annual flow: \\(P(Yri) = \\frac{i}{\\text{number of years}+1}\\) Scatter plot the flow vs probability curve. Assess the amount of water available for flow diversion for two scenarios by adding a new time-series column for each option: Water below 50 ML/day and above 550 ML/day is NOT diverted Water below 150 ML/day and above 1000 ML/day is NOT diverted Add two new columns for each of the above to work out cumulative amount of diverted water \\(X^{+1} = X +dX\\) Create a scatter plot of historical salinity (as EC) collected from the site marked in the map (+) vs daily discharge from the drain (see sheet: Estuary – Salinity). Fit a trendline to the data and display equation and R2 – this is a statistical model. In a new time-series column in the previous sheet, use the statistical model from above to predict a salinity time-series for the above station in the estuary under the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Q2: Table of the number of days daily flow within the above bands and annual average number of days Q3: Table of the annual amount of flow in total and in each band Q4: Table of annual flow by year with index and probability. Scatter plot of the flow vs probability curve Q6: Table of the cumulative amount of diverted water Q7 &amp; 8: Scatterplot of the EC vs. daily discharge from the drain, with trendline, equation and R2 value Q9: Plot of the salinity timeseries of the two diversion scenarios compared to the base case In less than 100 words, discuss which is the most appropriate scenario choice for management of the estuary These are in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded General professional formatting guidelines: All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them For graphs, figure captions go below the plot For tables, the caption goes above the table Make sure figures and their text size is readable Excel hints: When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title Remove the plot border and gridlines Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - ‘Temperature (°C)’ Round numbers to be reasonable "],
["module-2-biogeochemistry.html", "Module 2: Biogeochemistry Bacterially Mediated Organic Matter Oxidation Rates", " Module 2: Biogeochemistry Bacterially Mediated Organic Matter Oxidation Rates Objectives Become familiar with basic spread sheet commands in excel by building a simple biogeochemical model from chemical and mathematical equations. Become familiar with the program R Studio and compare it to Excel. Modelling concepts This model has variables of concentration and rate, no spatial dimensions, and it has a dimension of time. Last week’s model had variables of volume and concentration (salinity), and was also resolved in time. In coming weeks the models will be resolved in zero, one, two or three dimensions of space, and only some will be resolved in time. Going down the rows of the Excel spread sheet means going forward in time, as the differential equations break the time axis into hundreds of tiny little chunks. The concentration at any point in time may depend on concentration at the previous point in time. We use the notation concentrationt depends on concentrationt-1. Organic matter oxidation Organic matter (dead algae, leaves etc.) is oxidised by different bacteria that use a range of oxidants. The bacteria simultaneously consume organic matter and an oxidant, in a similar way to how humans consume carbohydrate and oxygen. Scientists have observed that there is a general sequence of oxidants used, based on the energy available for each process. When all of the oxidants are consumed, methanogenesis takes place, where bacteria use the organic matter alone without any oxidant. This is similar to the lactic acid metabolic system that the human body uses when oxygen is in short supply, such as when you go for a run. Remember that methane is a reduced byproduct, not an oxidant. Other reduced by-products include N2 gas, Mn2+ and Fe2+ metal ions, and the S2- anion. We can construct a model to determine the rates at which the oxidation takes place, and use the rates to determine other processes such as oxygen consumption, denitrification or phosphate adsorption. The rate is dependent on the concentration of the organic matter, \\(\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\), and a rate constant, \\(\\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\). The rate is not dependent on the concentration of the oxidant, until the oxidant concentration becomes very low: this process is included as a \\(\\color{#76923C}{\\text{limitation}}\\) term (With more O2 you do not become super; with less O2 you get sleepy). A \\(\\color{#76923C}{\\text{Monod}}\\) equation is used to limit the rate. \\[\\begin{equation} R_{O_{2}} = \\color{#00B0F0}{K_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{O_{2}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] The generally observed sequence of oxidants is modelled with an \\(\\color{#FF0000}{\\text{inhibition}}\\) process, so that a higher energy yielding oxidant, such as oxygen, inhibits a lower energy oxidant such as iron. \\[\\begin{align*} R_{NO_{3}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{NO_{3}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}}\\\\ \\tag{2}\\\\ R_{Mn} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Mn}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}}\\\\ \\tag{3}\\\\ R_{Fe} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{Fe}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}}\\\\ \\tag{4}\\\\ R_{SO_{4}} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#76923C}{\\frac{SO_{4}^{2-}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}}\\\\ \\tag{5}\\\\ R_{Meth} &amp;= \\color{#00B0F0}{k_{OM}}\\color{#E36C0A}{OM}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{SO_{4}}}{SO_{4}^{2-}+K_{SO_{4}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Fe}}{Fe+K_{Fe}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{Mn}}{Mn+K_{Mn}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{NO_{3}}}{NO_{3}+K_{NO_{3}}}}\\color{#FF0000}{\\frac{K_{O_{2}}}{O_{2}+K_{O_{2}}}}\\\\ \\tag{6}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] In this lab, we simulate a blob of aquatic sediment. It is a closed system, so that the initial concentrations react until they reach equilibrium. This system is also perfectly mixed, with an unchanging biomass of bacteria, and so there is no spatial resolution. This allows us to focus on the chemical reactions alone. Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet: MODULE02_Biogeochemistry.xlsx Download the R scripts: MODULE2_R_Biogeochem.zip Exercises Building the model in Excel Looking at the sequence of equations above: what is the difference between the limitation and the inhibition term? Have a good think about this. If concentration were amazingly bigger or smaller than the \\(K_{O_{x}}\\)1, what would happen to the rates of the higher and lower energy processes? For example, with a high oxygen concentration, what would happen to the manganese reduction rate? With a low oxygen and nitrate concentration, and a high manganese concentration, what would happen to the manganese oxidation rate? Complete the excel spreadsheet for iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Oxygen, nitrate and manganese are done already, so copy the method and use the equations at the tops of the columns. It is tedious, fiddly and there is a good chance that you will introduce bugs that are hard to find. This is the nature of Excel. Note that the rate is dependent on the concentration in the previous time step – this is called an explicit solution (as opposed to implicit). Complete the line plot (1) of relative oxidant concentration for iron and sulphate. Right click on the plot and use ‘Add data’, make the x axis time and the y axis relative concentration. It is easy to visualise if you keep the colours consistent, and choose the colours that you like. Adjust the values for the initial condition and the half-saturation constants and see how the lines move on your plot. Add more time steps underneath if you want to see what happens over the long term. Complete the area plot (2) of reaction rates, then play around with the numbers to test the sensitivities of the outputs to the parameter inputs Building the model in R Now the excel spreadsheet is working, the next step is to repeat the process in R. Open the R project and the three scripts: there is one in which you set the input parameters and initial conditions; one which has the equations; and one which is used for plotting the outputs. Read through them and become familiar with what is in each. Run each script in sequence, starting with Inputs, then Equations, then Plotting. The plotting script should make a plot appear in the bottom right corner. Enter the inputs, equations and plotting scripts for iron, sulfate and methanogenesis reactions, just as you did in the excel spreadsheet. Remember that you just need a rate of methanogenesis: methane is not an oxidant like sulfate. In the Plotting script, uncomment (remove the #s) the lines starting with png and dev.off. Now if you run the plot (3) again, it saves the plot to a .png file. You can edit the settings of the png line to create a high quality figure to put in the report. Now we have a working process-based model. This was the hard and boring part, but now we can be creative. So far we have established an initial condition and let it run to completion, but next we can model a hypothetical environmental situation. For example, imagine there were an oxygen fluctuation, perhaps from algal photosynthesis occurring in the day but not at night in a lake, or from the tidal movement of hypoxic water. In either Excel or R, create a new environmental situation that involves organic matter oxidation. Consider the assumptions you are making and how important they are. Use the model to test the effect of this situation on concentrations and rates. For example, what would happen if there were regular organic matter deposition as a boundary condition? Or maybe what if there were a constant oxygen concentration? What conditions might be needed to minimise methanogenesis? How could you maximise denitrification? I will give higher marks if you do something original and creative. Write a brief description of your new situation and create one plot (4) to explain your result. Submission Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab: Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in Excel Graph of rate (y) against time (x) area plot, for all oxidants Graph of concentration (y) against time (x) scatter plot, for all oxidants, made in R Any figure of a new environmental situation you create, and a brief explanation of lessthan 100 words of how you used the model creatively.

["module-3-climate-modeling.html", "Module 3: Climate Modeling Energy Balance Models", " Module 3: Climate Modeling Energy Balance Models Objectives To construct a simple energy balance climate model for the earth in Excel To understand the role of greenhouse gases, and incorporate them into an energy balance climate model Case Study 1: A “Zero-Dimensional” Energy Balance Model Here, we assume that the Earth is a sphere with uniform surface and no differences with latitude and longitude (i.e. everything receives the same amount of solar energy). We also assume that there is a balance, or equilibrium, between incoming short wavelength solar radiation absorbed by the ground and outgoing long wavelength radiation emitted by the ground. To simplify the model further, we assume the Earth emits outgoing (longwave) radiation like a “blackbody”, i.e. it is a perfectly efficient radiator - it gives off the maximum amount of radiation that an object of its temperature can emit. Outgoing Radiation The rate of the outgoing radiant energy (Joules per second = Watts) from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation: \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\sigma T^{4} \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\sigma\\): Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67x10-8) \\(T\\): Temperature (in degrees Kelvin) However, for the Earth, this is being emitted over the full surface area of the Earth: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{out}} = \\sigma 4\\pi r^{2} T^{4} \\tag{8} \\end{equation}\\] \\(r\\): Radius of the Earth (in m) Incoming Radiation The energy absorbed by the earth is given by the amount of incoming solar radiation which is not reflected due to albedo. However, we have to take into account that solar energy is striking the Earth as a parallel beam of circular cross-section. So this incoming beam of radiation hits only a single “disc” of the Earth’s surface at any one time. This area has a surface area \\(\\pi r^{2}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{abs}} = S\\pi r^{2} (1-a) \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(S\\): Incoming solar radiation: the “solar constant” (1367 W/m2) Exercises Using the concept of an energy balance (i.e. energy in = energy out), rearrange the equations to find the Earth’s temperature, \\(T\\). In Excel, construct a simple spreadsheet and fill in the blank cells to calculate the mean temperature of the Earth using the equation from Q1., assuming an albedo of 0.33 (including in °C and °F): Parameter Value Units Solar constant 1367 W/m2 Albedo 0.33 NA Stefan-Boltzmann constant 5.67E-08 NA Mean temperature of Earth ? K Mean temperature of Earth ? °C Mean temperature of Earth ? °F Remember: \\(K = °C + 273.2\\) and \\(°F = 1.8°C + 32\\) a) The current mean temperature of the Earth is 288K (15°C). Does this simple model over or under predict the Earth’s temperature? What important factor is missing from this model? 3) Test the sensitivity of this model to the choice of albedo. Using values from 0.3 to 0.7, calculate and plot T (°C) Albedo Solar constant Assumed Albedo Stefan-Boltzmann constant T (Celsius) 0.3 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 ? 0.4 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 ? 0.5 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 ? 0.6 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 ? 0.7 1367 0.33 5.67e-08 ? Case Study 2: A “quick fix” To try to reduce the error in the model estimates of Earth’s temperature, we can “parameterise” the model using observed or experimentally derived relationships between outgoing radiation and temperature. One such example is: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\text{out}} = x + yT \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] \\(x = 204\\) W/m2 \\(y = 2.17\\) W/m2/°C This gets inputted into the energy balance equation (energy in = energy out) to give: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi r^{2} S (1-a) = 4\\pi r^{2}(X+yT) \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] Exercises Solve the above equation for \\(T\\) (note, this time, \\(T\\) is in CELSIUS!) Set up a spreadsheet to estimate T for a range of albedo values. Different amounts of glacial ice cover on the Earth could produce albedos from 0.3 for minimal ice to 0.7 for a complete ice cover (this might seem unrealistic, but geologists have recently found evidence to suggest that the Earth was completely ice-covered during Neoproterozoic time 700 million years ago – a “snowball Earth”!) Albedo x y T (Celsius) 0.3 204 2.17 ? 0.4 204 2.17 ? 0.5 204 2.17 ? 0.6 204 2.17 ? 0.7 204 2.17 ? a) Are your results reasonably close for the present-day Earth mean temperature? What is the sensitivity of this model to small changes in albedo? b) Expanding a bit from your model (you might need to consider smaller steps in albedo), at what value of albedo do you think thissimplified Earth would experience strong positive feedback involving ice cover, albedo, and mean temperature, and therefore move rapidly toward “snowball Earth” with albedo = 0.7? Could it ever be deglaciated? Case Study 3: Incorporating Greenhouse Gases This model is a modification of the one described by Harte (1988). He showed that it is appropriate, based on the physics of radiation (as water is the major absolver of terrestrial radiation), to divide the Earth’s atmosphere into a lower layer (from the surface to 1.8km altitude, containing 20% of the air and 50% of the water vapour) and an upper layer (containing 80% of the air and 50% of the water vapour). This time we require three energy-balance equations: For the Earth-atmosphere system as a whole; For the upper layer of the atmosphere; For the lower layer of the atmosphere. In this model, all energy terms are expressed as long-term average fluxes, all temperatures are absolute. We assume that emissivity =1 except at the surface, and (most importantly) that each of the three systems is in equilibrium.

["module-4-oceanic-ph-calculation.html", "Module 4: Oceanic pH Calculation", " Module 4: Oceanic pH Calculation Objectives Calculate the carbonate species distribution given pH and CO2 (gas) Build a double-log plot based on a range of pHs Calculate the pH change and CaCO3 solubility given an increased atmospheric CO2. Replot other published data for comparison with our data Overview In this exercise, we create a simple model of the ocean, with a limited number of state variables. We examine the chemical interactions that result from atmospheric CO2 gas dissolving in water, along with calcium salts in the ocean fed by erosion of minerals on the land. The key overall process is that dissolved CO2 and Ca2+ are in equilibrium with solid CaCO3 (limestone). The major variables are given in Table 1. Given any two of the variables on the left hand column, the other four can be calculated. Exercise 1 In the first exercise, we set pH to be 8.3 and atmospheric CO2 gas to be 3.5×10-4 atmospheres, and calculate the other variables based on these two. CO2 gas dissolves in water according to equation (11). The dissolved CO2 easily dissociates into carbonic acid according to equation (12). For simplicity, we will go straight from atmospheric CO2 to H2CO3*, which is the sum of dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid, using equation (13). \\[\\begin{equation} {CO}_{2\\ \\left(\\text{gas}\\right)}\\rightleftarrows{CO}_{2\\ \\left(\\text{dissolved}\\right)} \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} {CO}_{2\\ \\left(\\text{dissolved}\\right)}+H_2O\\rightleftarrows H_2{CO}_3 \\tag{12} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} {CO}_{2\\ \\left(gas\\right)}+H_2O\\rightleftarrows H_2CO_3^\\ast \\hspace{3em} KH = 3.39×10-2 \\tag{13} \\end{equation}\\] The carbonic acid dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H+, or proton) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), according to equation (4). The bicarbonate further dissociates into carbonate (CO32-) and another hydrogen ion, as shown in equation (5). The release of these two hydrogen ions is what creates the acidity of the ocean. H_2CO_3HCO_3-+H^+ K1 = 5×10-7 (4) HCO_3^-_3{2-}+H+ K2 = 5×10-11 (5) Total carbon, CT, is defined as the sum of these carbonate species. Alkalinity is defined as the sum of the charged carbonate species and the balance of hydrogen ions and hydroxide (OH-), as shown in equations (6) and (7). (Remember that alkalinity is the opposite of acidity.) C_T=++(6) =+2+-(7) The concentration of hydroxide can be found by rearranging equation (8) to equation (9) and using the dissociation constant of water, KW, and the hydrogen ion concentration. =Kw KW = 1×10-14 (8) =Kw[H+] (9) Open the Excel spreadsheet or R project and examine the tab or script ‘Initial CO2’. The chemical equations and constants are given to you already. The variables that we are forcing to be constant in Excel are coloured grey. Enter the equations for Normal calculations into the yellow boxes. If we assume that calcium ion concentration does not vary much in this system, we can force it to be 5×10-4 mol L-1. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation or dissolution is governed by the ratio () of Ca2+ concentration and CO32- concentration to the solubility constant, Ksp, according to equations (10) and (11). If is greater than 1, then precipitation is favourable, and conversely, if is less than 1, dissolution is favourable. {CO}_3{2-}+{Ca}{2+}CaCO_3 Ksp = 1-8.4 (10) =[Ca2+][CO32-][Ksp CaCO3] (11) Have a good think about this: given these CO2 and pH, did your calculations lead to a system that favours CaCO3 dissolution or precipitation?
