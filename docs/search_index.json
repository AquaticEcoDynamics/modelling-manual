What is an environmental flow? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity Module resources Download the Excel spreadsheet here Case study Figure 1: Exercises You are given a time-series of daily river flow and need to assess how different diversion scenarios impact the freshwater flow delivery to a down stream estuary. For this flow time-series, calculate the volume of daily flow within the following bands 0-40; 40-80; 80-120; 120-200; 200-400; 400-1000; &gt;1000 Use Nested “IF” statement in adjacent columns to partition flows For this flow time-series, calculate the number of days daily flow within the above bands and work out annual average number of days Use COUNT() to get the number of entries in the column Calculate the annual amount of flow in total and in each band You may do the annual averaging manually or the pivot table method. For the pivot table method : Insert a new column B, Label it Year. Type the year number into the first cell, make sure it is formatted as a number. Click two times on the little square in the corner of the box. This will fill down the page. Repeat this at each year change and you will have the year only information which you can then use to summarise data. As the original date has day numbers and decimal time each one is unique so you end up with a record for each day. This way you get a record for each year. Highlight all the data. It must have headings for each column or it won’t work. Go to “Insert” then “Pivot Table”. Click OK as you want the default settings. Then you just fiddle until you get what you want. The following page is an example. "],
