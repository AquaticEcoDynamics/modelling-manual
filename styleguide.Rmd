## Figures {-}

### Good Graphs {-}

### Bad Graphs {-}

The following graphs leave a lot to be desired! They misrepresent data, lack critical details, and are visually jarring. Take a look at each and read the marker's feedback to get an idea of how your graphs will be assessed.

**Figure 1:**

</center>
Feedback:

- This is a graph of one number on a completely arbitrary scale
- We've been told it's the total 3 times but not what it's a total of!
- 5 decimal places! With the scale of this y-axis decimal places are serving no useful purpose here
- There's no units or y-axis label and a title has been used instead of a figure caption

**Figure 2:**

</center>
Feedback:

- A 3D visualisation is being used for 2D data
- No axis labels or units
- Missing a legend for the two lines plotted

**Figure 3:**

</center>
Feedback:

- A pie chart of what?
- Missing units and a legend
- Pie charts are a poor choice of visualisation for comparing numbers. The human eye is much less able to distinguish differences of scale for data represented as sectors of a circle compared to rectangles on a bar chart



## Tables {-}

All tables must be styled as per the following:

- **Table font size:** All table information is to be in 10pt font
- **Line spacing:** Within a table, line spacing is to single line spacing
- **Decimals:** Within a table column a common decimal place format is to be used
- **Heading separator:** A single solid line is to be used to separate column headings from numbers
- **Caption location:** The table caption must be placed above the table
- **Caption label font:** The caption label is to be in 12pt font
- **Caption label line spacing:** The caption label line spacing is to be single line spacing
- **Sub-groups:** Identification of subgroups with a line is optional
- **Pooled group:** Identification of a pooled group with a dashed line is optional
