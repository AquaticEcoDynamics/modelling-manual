# Module 7: Lake Ecosystem Dynamics {#M7_1 .unnumbered}

### Objectives {#M7_2 .unnumbered}

To use the GLM model to investigate water quality modelling in lakes and to incorporate a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model.

### Module Resources {#M7_3 .unnumbered}

This week, you'll be working through the [**GLM Workbook**](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/glm-workbook/). If you're not already familiar with GLM, start by reading the [Getting Started](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/glm-workbook/GettingStarted.html), [File Structure](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/glm-workbook/glm-file-structure.html), and [Running GLM](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/glm-workbook/running-glm.html) chapters.

Your task will be to complete the **Warm Lake Case Study**. 

```{block2, hintM7_1, type='rmdtip2'}
As you work through this chapter you may find it helpful to refer to some of the Exercises in the GLM workbook.
```

### Submission {#M7_13 .unnumbered}

::: {.redbox2}
**Submit properly formatted graphs and tables of the following sections of the lab:**

Lake Stratification:

-   Hand drawn diagram of the lake and any variables you used
-   Plots of the water balance
-   Plots of the heat fluxes
-   Plots of the temperature at different layers
-   Plots of the shallower lake

The Ecosystem Model:

-   Hand drawn diagram of the lake with any variables you used
-   Interesting plot of the selected variables
-   Any results of the higher air temperature and changed water clarity

Assessing Error & Sensitivity:

-   Temperature error assessment
-   Temperature and phytoplankton sensitivity assessment
-   Tables for submission

These are to be uploaded in a word doc or PDF format. No screenshots of figures from Excel/Excel spreadsheets to be uploaded

**General professional formatting guidelines:**

-   All figures are to have adequate captions explaining them
-   For graphs, figure captions go below the plot
-   For tables, the caption goes above the table
-   Make sure figures and their text size is readable

**Excel hints:**

-   When there is a caption for a plot, you remove the title
-   Remove the plot border and gridlines
-   Make sure both axes have visible lines and tick marks
-   Units need to be noted properly with the axis label - 'Temperature (Â°C)'
-   Round numbers to be reasonable
