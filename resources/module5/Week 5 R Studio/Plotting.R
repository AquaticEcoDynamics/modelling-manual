You should know now how to make a png file, and save it where you need to.
If you do not, then have a look at Week2 and Week 4, or google it.
If you want to put more than one variable on the same axis, use the functions 'points' or 'lines'
plot(time,P)
plot(time,Stot)
plot(time,Ssat)
plot(time,Sus)
plot(time,Susprime)
plot(time,Stotprime)
plot(time,etot)
plot(time,Qtot)
